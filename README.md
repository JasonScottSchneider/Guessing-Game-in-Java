# Guessing-Game-in-Java

If you cannot run JasonsGuessingGame.jar, it is probably because you do not have Java 11 installed. Therefore, I recommend downloading and running JasonsGuessingGame_jre8.jar instead if you have an older version of Java Runtime Envirionment installed on your computer. Linux will have the most updated version 11, but Windows might not have the latest updated version yet. This is why I recommend using the version compiled for JRE 8 instead if you are not sure.
